# Errors

```json
{
    "errors": [
        "param is missing or the value is empty: field"
    ]
}
```

The fieldwire API uses conventional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">HTTP status codes</a> to indicate success or failure of an API request.

Additionally, if the request fails validation checks errors are returned in the described format.
